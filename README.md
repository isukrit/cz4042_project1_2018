FAQs:

1) Do you prefer any particular Python library for coding? Are there any penalty/extra marks for any library? 

Answer: To simply answer your question, 'no', we don't favor any particular library while marking the assignments. You can use any of Tensorflow/Theano/Pytorch or any other Python library. Project 1 involves simple neural network models and it is a great opportunity for you to learn to build neural networks using these libraries. You will learn something new and you can use this knowledge to build complex neural network models. You will have to use the above mentioned libraries for Project 2, anyway.
